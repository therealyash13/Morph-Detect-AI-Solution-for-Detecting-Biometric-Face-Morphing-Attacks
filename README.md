# Morph-Detect-AI-Solution-for-Detecting-Biometric-Face-Morphing-Attacks

This project aims to develop an AI-driven solution for identifying manipulated biometric facial images and detecting biometric face morphing attacks. The goal is to achieve a high detection rate while reducing false-positive cases.

## Project Details

- Duration: January 2023 to April 2023
- Associated with Northeastern University
- Collaborated with Kingdom Capital, MO under the mentorship of Mr. Ernest Smiley

## Project Highlights

- Developed an AI-driven solution for detecting manipulated biometric facial images, resulting in an 80% reduction in false-positive cases and achieving a high detection rate of 95%.
- Trained and evaluated the MixFaceNet model using the CASIA Web-face dataset, which consists of over 25,000 real and synthetic images. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.5% and an F1 score of 0.95 in identifying attacked biometric facial images.
- Implemented the Morph Detect project using CUDA and the latest PyTorch version, resulting in a 50% increase in processing speed. The project utilized MixFaceNet, a deep learning network specifically designed for detecting face morphing attacks. MixFaceNet outperformed VGG16 and ResNet50 models in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

## Repository Structure

- `/Code Files/`: Contains the code files for the Morph Detect project.
- `/Input Files/`: Includes the input files required for running the code.
- `/DataSet/`: Holds the CASIA Web-face dataset used for training and evaluation.
